<h1>Angel Arechavaleta</h1>
<p>I would describe myself as a professional developer mastering all aspects of development, having the mindset that all things are but a puzzle which just require time and bit of effort to complete. I also have several years of experience as a MSSQL DBA and have held many Microsoft certifications. I'm typically always available on Skype chat: Angel Arechavaleta
</p>
<p>
I can ensure the quality of my work leveraging my many years of coding. Drawing on my abilities to build and utilize complex programming languages. I am proficient in all stages of the Development process from planning and conceptualizing to release infrastructure verification and post-release Q/A . Throughout my career, I have worked in many different environments, following methodologies from Agile SCRUM to the madness of J.G.D (Just get it done).
</p>
<p>
I thrive in an environment where I can test the boundaries of the software but also contribute to the QA process and procedures used to ensure quality. My passion is in COMPLETING projects and I would like to help whomever will find my skills suitable for their projects. </p>
